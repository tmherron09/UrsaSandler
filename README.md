Website for the Ursa Sandler Movie Club. In-progress site with main goals of storing member reviews, comments, and tracking attendance (including post-dated attendance for mid-2020).


Status- live Link, timherron.dev/ursasandler
Waiting on Sandler section finale, discussing how best to structure our new club structure with topic based viewing periods (aka, trial 1 with Disnay TV movies, each member
picking one of thier choosing, and potentially one or two deemed classics or nescessary.)

Member Section Pulled- reworking presently to encompass the new upcoming club transition.
